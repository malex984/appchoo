appchoo takes a list of newline delimited apps and their pictures on stdin.
after EOF it will fit those pictures to the screen and make them available
as buttons. clicking (or touching on a touchscreen) one of the pictures will
emit the app to stdout and exit.

so you can choose apps to start like this:

# exec `echo -e 'app1.jpg ./app1\napp2.jpg ./app2' | ./appchoo`

another example but now hiding the cursor with the "-c" option:

# exec $(./appchoo -c < applist)

use "-t NUM" to set timeout to NUM seconds.

use "-d 'CMD'" to emit 'CMD' instead of 'true' on timeout.

lines beginning with '#' get ignored:

# cat applist
app1.jpg ./app1
#app2.jpg ./app2
app3.jpg ./app
